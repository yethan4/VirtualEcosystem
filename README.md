# Virtual Ecosystem

This is a university lab project written in **C++** as part of a course on Object-Oriented Programming.  
The code and structure follow the requirements defined in the official lab manual (written in Polish).

## ðŸ§  What I learned from the course and this project

- **C++ syntax** â€“ conditional statements, loops, variables, and type casting.
- **Pointers and references** â€“ alternative ways of accessing and modifying data.
- **Object-oriented programming (OOP)** â€“ creating classes, objects, constructors, and destructors.
- **Inheritance, polymorphism, and abstract classes** â€“ applying advanced OOP concepts.
- **STL and operator overloading** â€“ using standard containers and defining custom operators.
- **Dynamic memory allocation** â€“ creating and deleting objects at runtime.
- **Ecosystem simulation** â€“ building a simplified model of biological interactions between organisms.
- **File and string handling** â€“ reading/writing data and formatting text.
- **Console interface** â€“ creating basic text-based animations and interactive menus.
